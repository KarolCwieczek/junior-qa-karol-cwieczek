Please, write your answer below:

Hello Kapil,

By default CKEditor 4 height is set to 200 pixels but the editor width equals the width of its container element in the page.
You can obtain the same automatically adjusting height functionality by installing Auto Grow plugin.

I'd also recommend You to check Editor Resize plugin which provides numerous resize options for the classic editor, including
the manual resize handle, setting minimum and maximum editor dimensions after resizing or influencing the resize direction.

But if You want to change CKEditor 4 height manually the best way to achieve it is to find CKEDITOR.config.height settings
file where You can set the height of the editing area to whatever value You want.

If You have more questions don't hesitate to ask. I'd be happy to help,
Charles
